    description:
      "The dinner plate Gerbera is part of the Giant Bloom service and was realized on the MEISSEN® Cosmopolitan form. The spring-like service surprises with new floral décors such as lilies, hibiscus and peonies. Inspired by the Giant Bloom vase from the Limited Masterworks 2021, the lavish hand paintings cover the objects in a stylized form. The interplay of concentrated color surfaces and white, empty space creates a clear and inspiring modernity. Bring a spring-like ambience to your table at home with the Giant Bloom service and let one of the most popular German cut flowers shine on your service with the Gerbera dinner plate. The decor is carefully applied by hand to the white and glazed porcelain. The section of the gerbera is extremely enlarged and thus represents a novelty in the painting of the Meissen manufactory.",
